This is a website to help people maintain a daily writing habit.

They can set a goal, specifying the number of words they want to write per day.

If they meet this goal, the site shows a checkmark next to that date.

If they don't meet the goal for the day, they get an "X".

The site tracks users' "streaks." If they meet their goal for multiple days in
a row, their current "streak" increases. If they miss a day, the streak resets
to 0. The user's longest streak is recorded and reported.

If a user wants to update their time zone or their "goal", they can, although
this resets their streak, and their successes prior to the change are no longer
reported.
