This is intended to be a webapp to help people keep up a regular writing habit. 

Largely unimplemented, vaguely-defined goals:

Lets the user set goals (like x number of minutes of writing daily), and helps them track their goals. 

Tracks the time they spend writing in the app, with the option to stop the timer if the app loses focus. 

Allow option to LIMIT time spent on the writing as well.

Lets the user save their writing, and optionally share it. Allow them to share an entire set of writings - for example, if they have a goal of spending 10+ minutes writing every day, they can get a shareable link to all of those daily writings.
